2025-07-11 12:29:32,689 [INFO] ðŸ’¬ Content: ask: Can you make a pie chart for the different roles of employees?
2025-07-11 12:29:32,791 [INFO] User <@485308464050995245> (Admin) is using agent with tools: ['query', 'summarize', 'summarize_by_time', 'search']
2025-07-11 12:29:33,899 [INFO] Task: The user wants a pie chart visualizing the distribution of employee roles. This requires querying the database to get the roles and their counts, and then a tool that can create visualizations. Since the available tools do not directly support creating charts, I will first query the database to get the data needed for the chart.
Tool calls: [{'name': 'query', 'args': {'user_id': '485308464050995245', 'user_query': 'Show the count of employees for each role'}, 'id': 'c3d2151e-4f71-4e10-80c2-cb1e5c586c22', 'type': 'tool_call'}]
2025-07-11 12:29:37,103 [INFO] Response does not contain any tool calls.
