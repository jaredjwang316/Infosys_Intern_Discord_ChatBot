# Discord ChatBot
A sophisticated Discord bot powered by Google's Gemini AI that provides intelligent conversation, database querying, conversation search, and summarization capabilities.  The bot can dynamically determine user's intent and decide whether to respond directly or invoke specialized tools such as database querying, conversation search, and summarization, instead of relying on hard-coded command keywords.  In the other words, the agent uses contextual reasoning to select the appropriate actionsâ€”enabling a more natural, adaptive interaction experience.

## Project Overview
This Discord chatbot integrates with postgres databases and uses advanced AI features including:
- Natural language conversation with context awareness
- SQL query generation and execution
- Conversation search using vector embeddings
- Automatic conversation summarization
- Time-based conversation filtering

## Files Structure

### Core Files

## discord_bot.py
This is the main Discord bot file that handles all Discord interactions. It contains various tools and commands that can be triggered by specific keywords and provides:
- Message handling with user and channel-specific memory
- Intelligent decision-making to determine when to use tools such as querying, search, and summarization  
- Integration with all function modules
- Test utilities for development

## setup_database.py
A comprehensive database setup and seeding script that:
- Connects to a PostgreSQL database using credentials from an .env file
- Executes the database schema from `Schema_test.sql`
- Seeds the database with realistic test data including:
  - 20 employees with various roles
  - 5 clients across different industries
  - 10 projects with assignments
  - Skills and employee-skill relationships
- Uses the Faker library to generate realistic sample data

## requirements.txt
Contains all Python dependencies needed for the project:
- Discord.py for Discord bot functionality
- LangChain ecosystem for AI and embedding features
- Google Generative AI for Gemini integration
- Psycopg2 for database connection
- Vector storage libraries (pgVector)
- Additional utilities (python-dotenv, faker)

### Database Structure

## database/Schema_test.sql
Defines the complete MySQL database schema with six main tables:
- `employees` - Infosys staff information
- `clients` - External clients served by Infosys
- `projects` - Client projects managed by Infosys
- `employee_project_assignments` - Many-to-many relationship between employees and projects
- `skills` - Catalog of technical skills
- `employee_skills` - Many-to-many relationship between employees and their skills

## database/schema.txt
Auto-generated formatted version of the SQL schema used by the query function for AI context.

### Function Modules

## functions/query.py
Advanced database querying module that:
- Connects to the postgreSQL database using environment variables
- Uses Google's Gemini AI to convert natural language to SQL
- Validates SQL queries against allowed tables for security
- Maintains conversation history for context-aware responses
- Handles database errors gracefully
- Provides intelligent responses based on query results

## functions/search.py
Conversation search functionality using vector embeddings:
- Converts conversation history into searchable documents
- Uses Google's text-embedding-004 model for embeddings
- Implemented semantic search using pgVector with cosine similarity
- Supports both timestamped and non-timestamped conversation formats
- Returns relevant conversation snippets based on search queries

## functions/summary.py
Intelligent conversation summarization:
- Processes conversation history with flexible timestamp support
- Uses Gemini AI to generate structured summaries
- Formats output with headers and bullet points
- Handles both user-bot conversations with proper role identification
- Supports time-based conversation filtering

## Bot Commands

The Discord bot responds to several specific commands:

### Basic Commands
- `help` - Display all available commands
- `clear` - Clear conversation memory
- `exit` - Stop the bot

### AI Features
- `ask: <your question> - Have a natural conversation with the bot.  

### Development/Testing
- `test` - Display user ID and basic info
- `show_history` - Display current conversation history
- `where_am_i` - Show current channel information
- `gen_time` - Generate sample conversation with timestamps
- `gen_no_time` - Generate sample conversation without timestamps

## Setup Instructions

1. **Environment Variables**: Create a `.env` file with:
   ```
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
   DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token
   MODEL_NAME=gemini-1.5-flash
   DB_HOST=<endpoint of your database instance>
   DB_PORT=5432 
   DB_USER=<master username>
   DB_PASSWORD=<master password>
   DB_NAME="postgres"
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Setup Database**:
   ```bash
   python setup_database.py
   ```

4. **Run the Bot**:
   ```bash
   python discord_bot.py
   ```

## Technical Features

- **Memory Management**: Separate conversation histories per user and channel
- **Response Splitting**: Automatically splits long AI responses to fit Discord's message limits
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for database and AI operations
- **Security**: SQL injection protection through query validation
- **Scalability**: Vector-based search for efficient conversation retrieval
